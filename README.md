            In this tutorial you will learn to detect face and eyes in Python using OpenCV library and the Haar Cascade for the object detection.
            <br><br>
            Face detection is a computer vision technology that helps to find faces.This method uses the object detection technology that deals with detecting objects in the given image.

                OpenCV was started at Intel in the year 1999 by Gary Bradsky. The first release came a little later in the year 2000. OpenCV essentially stands for Open Source Computer Vision Library. Although it is written in optimized C/C++, it has interfaces for Python and Java along with C++. OpenCV boasts of an active user base all over the world with its use increasing day by day due to the surge in computer vision applications.
